# Chessboard-Hardware

Hardware for a magnetic-piece-tracking digital chessboard! WIP

This repository contains the KiCad PCB project for the majority of the Chessboard's wiring. 
For the CAD files, see [Chessboard-Design](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/Chessboard-Design).
For the Arduino Nano firmware, see [Chessboard-Nano](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/Chessboard-Nano).
For the Raspberry Pi firmware, see Chessboard-Pi.

## Notes

### Models

All models were modified in Fusion 360. 

* Arduino Nano was modified from [joel10s's model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3863918) and colors are inspired by [
Raafat Mohamed's model](https://grabcad.com/library/arduino-nano-26).
* SS49E was modified from the [SnapMagic library](https://www.snapeda.com/parts/SS49E/Honeywell/view-part/?ref=digikey).
